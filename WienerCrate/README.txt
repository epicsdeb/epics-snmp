This is an example of an instrument support module based on devSnmp.
It is a standalone EPICS <TOP> since, although it is distributed with the
devSnp support module , it would typically be located elsewhere.   For example,
the devSnmp support module could be at
    /usr/local/epics/R3.14.12/modules/soft/SNMP-NSCL/R1.1/
while the WienerCrate support module would be at
    /usr/local/epics/R3.14.12/modules/instrument/WienerCrate/R1.0/
